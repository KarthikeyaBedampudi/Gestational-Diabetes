# Gestational-Diabetes
## About Dataset
Gestational diabetes is a type of high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy. It can occur at any stage of pregnancy and cause problems for both the mother and the baby, during and after birth. The risks can be reduced if they are early detected and managed, especially in areas where only periodic tests of pregnant women are available. Intelligent systems designed by machine learning algorithms are remodelling all fields of our lives, including the healthcare system. This study proposes a combined prediction model to diagnose gestational diabetes. The dataset was obtained from the Kurdistan region laboratories, which collected information from pregnant women with and without diabetes.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) that performs comprehensive statistical analysis on a gestational diabetes dataset. The notebook explores various statistical methods, data visualizations, and insights related to the dataset, offering valuable perspectives on gestational diabetes. It is designed for data scientists, healthcare professionals, and researchers looking to understand patterns and trends within the data, providing both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced statistical techniques.
